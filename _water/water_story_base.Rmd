2. Frequencies and Proportions
3. Bar Graph Visualization
4. Two-Group Categorical Comparisons ()

*Chapters:*
1. Introduction
2. ACME Consulting Arrives
3. Intial Analysis
4. Contact with Dr. Lead
5. Switch is made
6. Exercises

*Learning Objectives:*
1. Calculating Frequencies in R
2. Calculating Proprotions in R 
3. Visualization using Bar Graphs in R
4. Hypothesis Testing - Two Independent Categorical Groups in R

*Characters:*
**StatCat**
Core Traits - Old-fashioned, knows the statistics concepts very well, does not trust programming and afraid of change, confident in what he "thinks" he knows.

**DataDog:**
Core Traits - Modernized, short-attention span, scratches the surfaces with statistics, expert at programming

**Dr.Lead**
Core Traits - inherently evil, physical traits like "The Blob", infects homes, children

**Citizens**
Core Traits - concerned, motivated, wants to pretect families and community

# Chapter 1 - Introduction
# ------------------------------------------------------------------

Pl.
*April 2014*
*Newspaper article headline reads "FLint Water Bills to Drop!*

Pl.
*Text of the newspaper article with quotes/pictures from city council members, explaining the switch in water supply, proud of their acheivements*

Pl.
*Citizens ask questions about safety, city assures them it is safe, foreshadowing of the problems*

Pl.
*Setting shifts to the new piping*
*Dr.Lead starts to slowly form*

PL.
*Dr.Lead explains motive*
*Dr.Lead starts seeping into buildings, schools*


Pl.
*Several Months Later*
*Setiing is a mother (Parent 1), looking after a sick child who has Legionnairesâ€™ disease*
*Empty plastic water bottles laying around*

Pl.
*Phone rings, another parent (Parent 2) is on the phone*
*Parent 2 asks how Parent 1 child is doing*

Pl.
*Conversation changes to more frustrated tone, complaining*
*"This is rediculous..."*
*"We haven't had clean water in months...."*
*"Water from the sink smells, brownish color"*

Pl.
*"Despite our protests to the city, they still assure us everything is safe*

Pl.
*Parent 2 explains that the we (citizens) have to take action in our own hands*
*Who do we call?*
*ACME consulting*

# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter 2: ACME Arrives
# Goal: Use base R functions to import data (Review)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------

Pl.
*January 2015*

Pl.
*StatCat and DataDog fly out to Flint*

Pl.
*Water samples start being collected*
*High motivation from the citizens*

Pl.
*Water samples start being collected*

Pl.
*StatCat and DataDog start running the lab analysis to test to see the amount of lead in the water*

Pl.
*DataDog has his intern (Student) import the dataset into R*

EXERCISE (Review)
1. Set working directory
2. Import the flint_water_samples_all.csv
3. Provide the first 5 observations

# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter 3: Initial Analysis
# Goal: Frequencies and Proprotions
# ------------------------------------------------------------------

Calcualte the frequencies and proportion (prevalance) of homes with elevated lead in the water

More than 5 ppb is determined as unsafe

Shocked realization from the team, team must contact the city to get them to change water supplies

Contact with Dr.Lead, Dr.Lead tries to stop them (abruptly ends at contact)


# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter 4: Contact With Dr. Lead
# Goal: Bar Graph
# ------------------------------------------------------------------

Need to integrate bar graph into the story

*NEED A WAY TO DEFEAT DR.LEAD*
*Possibly something with Citizen Science, boiling?, switching water supplies is the only way to defeat?*

Gets the city to switch back water supplies


# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter 5: Switch is Made!
# Goal: Contigency Table and Odds Ratio
# ------------------------------------------------------------------

Year is 2016

Issues start to resolve over time, no more odor in the water

More water samples are collected

Re-calculate frequencies and prevalence

Citizens need a way to see if the problem has resolved

StatCat consults them to calculate odds ratio

DataDog creates the coding

Odds ratio shows water collected after the switch is signficiantly less likely to have elevated lead levels

Team is happy

Dr.Lead still lurks out there...

# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter 6: 
# Goal: Exercise
# ------------------------------------------------------------------

From 2013 through 2015, pediatricians routinely tested the lead levels in the blood. Using the data provided, demonstrate that there was a signficantly higher prevalence of elevated blood lead levels in 2015 (after the switch) compared to 2013. EBLL defined as > 5 ug/dL
REF: https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdfplus/10.2105/AJPH.2015.303003

1. Import flint_data_blood_samples.csv
2. Determine the frequency and prevalence of elevated blood for each year
3. Illustrate using a bar graph
4. Create a 2x2 contingency table
5. Calculate odds ratio
6. Interpret odds ratio
