This folder contains the work Drew Cistola completed over the summer. 

This folder contains four complete narrative experiences inside Jupyter Notebooks that provide Step by step instruction on basic data skills.

These stories each include:
1. A Literary narrative
2. Real world datasets
3. Data manipulation and cleaning
4. Graphical and GIS outputs
5. Basic statistical tests
6. A data challenge with Florida data
7. Matching versions in Python and R

The four stories roughly focus on:

Wealth - Tale of Two Cities: Wealth Concentration and Life Expectancy in OECD Countries

Fish - Cannery Row: Sea Temperature and Sardine Fisheries in Southern California

Vote - All the Kings Men: Realignment Theory and the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election

Crime - Native Son: Crime and Race by neighborhood in Chicago, IL

These products are ready to be used to pilot test the My Data Story model and provide initial feedback and publications.
