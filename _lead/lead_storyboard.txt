NOTES =========================================================================================================================
Flint –
Intro – Andy / Alley is dredging around in the data muck and he comes across this idea that data can have real consequences. It can
inform whether people live or die. DD and SC step in to talk about Flint, Michigan. 

Lead
Characters should be aspirational. 
The mom is someone who has aspirations. Wants to become a translational scientist or public relation specialist. She has a certain level
of drive, energy, and spunk. Both mother and daughter lighter. 
She comes from a poor background but set her sights high and wants to get there. They’re all moving up. They move to Michigan in 2013.
The daughter is starting 1st grade. (Christmas of 2013?) Mom is getting the daughter some presents, etc .

Then what happens in 2014 – town hall, the city fathers have “got to save money”  because the city Is under state control. There is no
democracy. They make the decision to switch over to a cheaper water supply to cut costs. 

The daughter comes home and says she can’t focus at school. At a parent/teacher conference the teacher says many of the students are
beginning to struggle – ADHD, aggression, all mental things attached to lead poisoning. That’s when mom hears about the water issue in
Flint and she feels a need to understand what is happening. She has just enough data skill she begins searching the data sets (before
and after comparison in the data). She is alarmed by her findings and is worried about her daughter (family) is being poisoned. 

Lead is most destructive in the developing brain. 
Mom gets the data and comes into contact with Dr. Mona Hanna Motecia.(sp) They demand the city switch back to its previous water supply.
The city goes back to the unpolluted water supply.
