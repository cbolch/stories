#### Linking to Sections in the Core Explanatory Learning Experiences

Anchor tags are embedded in the RMarkdown or Jupyter Notebook documents.  These should match the section name and are formatted as follows: \<a id="getting_help_on_packages"></a>

This anchor can then be called by specifying the section name after the # character, as follows:  

https://rawcdn.githack.com/mydatastory/r_intro_class/9eb06a608223e7a34721bab4ae627612a496cb28/_episodes_html/seeking_help_toc.html#getting_help_on_packages

Because we use githack to render GitHub .html pages, you must go to their site to obtain a unique url for the resource and then append a specific section name to it if you want to link to a location within the document.
