The civilization was called the [Chachapoyan culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chachapoya_culture)

-----------------------------------------------------
#### Story Notes (Return to Eden)

Introduce a new bird character (Pikachu?) who finds a Chachapoyan clay pot with birds around it.  This, in turn, leads to a desire to recreate the glories of that ancient civilization where the human and bird kingdoms worked together to create an earthly Eden.  At that time, millions of birds filled the skies and thousands of avian species lived in harmony with their human friends.

Pikachu dreams of recreating this ancient Eden, but she needs help figuring out how to create an appropriate environment, one suitable for both birds and humans.  So she picks up her phone and calls ACME consulting.  DataDog or StatCat answers the phone and a conversation ensues.  Naturally, our two super-heroes are enthralled with the prospect of flying to Peru and assisting Big Bird.

Immediately, our two heroes book a flight to Peru and we see them departing the plane in ridiculous tourist attire with oversized sombreros and outrageous Latin-American shirts.  Pikachu meets them at the airport and they drive to the cloud rain-forests.  As soon as they arrive, Pikachu calls a meeting with the local village elders to discuss her Edenic vision.  We see everyone (humans and birds) gathered around a council table as Big Bird shares her pottery find, information about this ancient civilization, and desire to create a new Eden, patterned after the one which existed.  The tribal chiefs discuss the vision and everyone decides to work together to make this happen.

Pikachu, StatCat, and DataDog develop a data plan and we see them in the forest collecting data.  StatCat has a bit of an edge in this situation as the local community does not have access to much technology.

Note: Pikachu is patterned after [La Caponata](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Gallina_Caponata), the Spanish equivalent of Big Bird in their version of Sesame Street.
