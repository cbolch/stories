## Sheldon Cooper's Relationship Agreement
In the *Big Bang Theory* TV series, the show's resident genius - Sheldon Cooper - enjoys creating legally-binding agreements that specify the particulars of any relationship he is presently in.  His budding romance with Amy is regulated by their relationship agreement, as is his relationship with his roommate, Leonard Hofstadter.

## R Functions
The fundamental concept behind functions is the notion of a contract.  Just as Sheldon's relationship and roommate agreements ensure that the parties involved will act in regular and predictable ways, so too the interface to a function is like a contract.  If the code calling a function does this - pass the correct arguments in the correct order - a well written function responds in a predictable way, providing the promised output.

```{r fig.width = 3.75, fig.height = 3.75}

# Set the working directory to the folder with the data file.
setwd("C:/informatics")

# Read the .csv file into the df_tmp dataframe.
df_tmp <- read.csv("gapminder.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Create a vector of the countries to be graphed.
countries <- c('United States','France','Brazil')

# Create a vector of the line colors for each country.
line_colors <- c('darkblue','darkred','darkgreen')

# Create the base plot.
plot(1, main = "Life Expectancy", xlab = "Year", ylab = "Years", col  = "darkblue", 
     type = "l", xlim = c(1950, 2010), ylim = c(50, 85))

max_rows <- NROW(countries)      

for(idx in 1:max_rows) {               
  df_gap <- df_tmp[df_tmp$country == countries[idx],]
  
  lines(df_gap$year, df_gap$lifeExp, col = line_colors[idx])
}

```

</div>

In the code above, we loop through both vectors, subsetting the data and then creating a line, using the color specified at the index of the line_colors vector.  Of course, the countries and line_colors vectors need to be the same length and align with each other.  That is, the line color at a specified index must be the one you wish to use for the country at that same index in the other vector.  For example, the line color at `line_colors[1]` is darkblue and the corresponding country at `countries[1]` is the United States.  Thus the U.S. line will be darkblue.

A generic design pattern is now coming into view.  Like the Pac-Man video game, loops "eat" data.  In other words, we often loop through a dataset to perform some action.  It does not matter how the data is stored - in a vector, a list, or a dataframe - just as long as the elements (rows) in it are accessible via index.

What makes the data-driven loop pattern so powerful is that the number of countries for which we want to draw the lines can be as large as you like without having any effect on the amount of code written. That was not the case with the earlier "cut and paste" method.

## Review

In this myDataStory learning experience, we introduced you to R functions, using Sheldon Cooper's legal agreements as a fun way to introduce the idea of contract and black-box functional programming.

Here are the key points:

* Frequently, you will find yourself copying and pasting a block of code repeatedly, with but minor modifications.  When this happens, consider the power of loops to cut down on the amount of code you write.  Always keep this dictum in mind, "Thou shalt not repeat thyself!" 

* If you begin to repeat yourself, first determine what is changing in each block of code.  Then, try to replace the changing pieces with code that relies on indexes.  For example, we replaced 'United States','France', and 'Brazil' with `countries[1]`,`countries[2]`, and `countries[3]` respectively.  Finally, if we're able to do this, we can probably use loops to avoid repetition.

* Avoid the dreaded infinite loop by always ensuring that an exit condition is met.  In some cases, this will require you to increment an index variable, as is the case with `while` loops.
