## Sheldon Cooper's Relationship Agreement
In the *Big Bang Theory* TV series, the show's resident genius - Sheldon Cooper - enjoys creating legally-binding agreements that specify the particulars of any relationship he is presently in.  His budding romance with Amy is regulated by their relationship agreement, as is his relationship with his roommate, Leonard Hofstadter.

## R Functions
The fundamental concept behind functions is the notion of a contract.  Just as Sheldon's relationship and roommate agreements ensure that the parties involved will act in regular and predictable ways, so too the interface to a function is like a contract.  If a call to a function passes the correct arguments in the correct order, a well written function responds in a predictable way, providing the promised output.  

Let's revisit the code we wrote in the loops clinic to illustrate the process of writing a custom function.

```{r fig.width = 3.75, fig.height = 3.75}

# Set the working directory to the folder with the data file.
setwd("C:/informatics")

# Read the .csv file into the df_tmp dataframe.
df_tmp <- read.csv("gapminder.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Create a vector of the countries to be graphed.
countries <- c('United States','France','Brazil')

# Create a vector of the line colors for each country.
line_colors <- c('darkblue','darkred','darkgreen')

# Create the base plot.
plot(1, main = "Life Expectancy", xlab = "Year", ylab = "Years", col  = "darkblue", 
     type = "l", xlim = c(1950, 2010), ylim = c(50, 85))

max_rows <- NROW(countries)      

for(idx in 1:max_rows) {               
  df_gap <- df_tmp[df_tmp$country == countries[idx],]
  
  lines(df_gap$year, df_gap$lifeExp, col = line_colors[idx])
}

```

Before writing the function, we need to first specify its name, arguments, and output.  The code in the block above plots life expectancies for three countries over time, from 1950 to 2010.  So let's call our new function: *plot_life_expect()* and obviously we want this function to create a line graph.  A graph is therefore the desired **output**.  In this example, the function won't *return* anything to the code that calls it.  Rather, it will simply create a graph.  (Keep in mind that most functions do indeed return values to their callers).

With a name selected and output defined, our next step is to define the function's arguments.  Given this code, what arguments do we need to pass to this new function?  Did you consider the two vectors - *countries* and *line_colors* - as possible candidates?  If so, give yourself an A.  An initial definition of the interface is listed in the code chunk below.


```{r eval = FALSE}

# -------------------------------------------------------
#' @title plot_life_expect
#' @details This function creates a life expectancy line plot for a vector of countries. 
#' @export
#' @param vector input countries and line colors
#' @return
#' @keywords life expectancy
#' @author Dan Maxwell
#' @examples
#' plot_life_expect(countries, line_colors)
# -------------------------------------------------------

plot_life_expect <- function(countries, line_colors)
{
  
}

```

This might seem like a lot of documentation to create a simple function.  But the effort is well rewarded once you decide to create a package.  (In a future clinic, we cover package development and construction.)

## Review

In this myDataStory learning experience, we introduced you to R functions, using Sheldon Cooper's legal agreements as a fun way to introduce the idea of contract and black-box functional programming.

Here are the key points:

* Frequently, you will find yourself copying and pasting a block of code repeatedly, with but minor modifications.  When this happens, consider the power of loops to cut down on the amount of code you write.  Always keep this dictum in mind, "Thou shalt not repeat thyself!" 

* If you begin to repeat yourself, first determine what is changing in each block of code.  Then, try to replace the changing pieces with code that relies on indexes.  For example, we replaced 'United States','France', and 'Brazil' with `countries[1]`,`countries[2]`, and `countries[3]` respectively.  Finally, if we're able to do this, we can probably use loops to avoid repetition.

* Avoid the dreaded infinite loop by always ensuring that an exit condition is met.  In some cases, this will require you to increment an index variable, as is the case with `while` loops.
