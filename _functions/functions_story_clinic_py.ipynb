    "The fundamental concept behind functions is the notion of a contract.  Just as Sheldon's relationship and roommate agreements ensure that the parties involved will act in regular and predictable ways, so too the interface to a function is like a contract.  If a call to a function passes the correct arguments in the correct order, a well written function responds in a predictable way, providing the promised output. \n",
    "\n",
    "Counterintuitively, the first step in creating a function is to define what it will do.  I say \"counterintuitively\" because most programmers simply dive right in and start writing code.  This strategy works well for small and rather simple programs.  However, you'll quickly run into trouble when the complexity begins to increase.  For that reason, seasoned software developers usually begin by writing a specification (spec) - a document that spells out the terms of the contract.  A well-written specification typically includes interface documentation as well as pseudocode, a clear statement in plain English of the steps to be taken to accomplish the function's task.\n",

For more complex functions, however,  pseudocode is strongly recommended as it helps you understand the flow and logic of your program before you start coding.

For those who've programmed in other languages such as C, the answer appears to be simple.  Just check the datatypes upfront, at the start of the function.  But this is not the Python way.  Instead, Python encourages what's known as *duck typing.*  The idea is simple.  If it looks like a duck, waddles like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then why validate that it's a duck?
