Now it is your turn to try your statistical skills and smoothing techniques!

# Exercise
Now that we have looked at the sardine catch and ocean temperature data before 1968, let's investigate any possible trends in the data after 1968.

## Steps:
1. Subset the sardine catch and temperature data to have year >= 1968 and month only Feburary to April.

2. Create separate graphs from the raw data for temperature and sardine landings.

3. **QUESTIONS:**
    1. What do you see from the graphs? What comparisons can you make between the data from before 1968 and the data after 1968?
    2. What data should be used to move forward in this investigation?

4. Use the temperature data to predict sardine landings after 1968. Make an appropriate graph with a linear regression line using the data selected and interpret the correlation value.

5. **QUESTION:**
    1. What do you see from the graph using the subset of data after 1968?
